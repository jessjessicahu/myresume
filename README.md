<h3>Predictive Modeling</h3>
<h4><i>King County House Price Variations Factors Analysis</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Discovered crucial influences on sold house prices in a dataset of 21 variables using R</li>
  <li>Applied one-way ANOVA and Pearson’s coefficient r to recognize variables highly correlated to prices</li>
  <li>Explored potential association within variables by exploiting correlation matrix and partial correlation test</li>
  <li>Constructed predictive model using backward stepwise regression results in adjusted r-squared of 0.87</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<h4><i>Analysis of Alaska Airlines Competitors</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Created interactive dashboard using Tableau with on-time flight dataset from U.S. department of transportation</li>
  <li>Recognized Southwest as competitor for being the only carrier has more flight services to Alaska’s popular paths</li>
  <li>Discovered Alaska has better performance on delay time yet worse on longer flying time compare to Southwest</li>
  <li>Developed business suggestions based on research outcome and delivered 20-min presentation which scored A</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
<h4><i>Analysis of politeness in sentences</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Devised computational approach to characterize politeness marking of sentences using Python</li>
  <li>Tokenized training datasets using n-gram tokenizer and calculate tf-idf of each features</li>
  <li>Identified the best method based on accuracy on a grid of possible combinations by using GridSearch</li>
  <li>Achieved the second highest accuracy of 62.6% among all class</li>  
</ul>

<h3>Deep Learning</h3>
<h4><i>Deep Learning: Facial Expression Recognition</i></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Classified 48*48-pixel images of faces in to 7 categories by training more than 28,000 images</li>
  <li>Performed data augmentation to solve the problem of unbalanced training set</li>
  <li>Constructed 4 different CNN models with altered dropout rate and learning rate to recognize the best method</li>
  <li>Reduced training accuracy from 99.6% to 70% to alleviate overfitting problem of original model with final result of    65.6% testing accuracy and cross entropy loss approximate to 1</li>
</ul>
